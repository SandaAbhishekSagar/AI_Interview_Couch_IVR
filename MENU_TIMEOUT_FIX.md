# Menu Timeout Fix - Complete Solution ✅

## 🔍 The Problem

Your logs showed:
```
POST /webhook/menu - 15013ms - 502
Request to /webhook/menu timed out
```

**Why**: The `/webhook/menu` endpoint was doing too much work:
1. Finding/creating user (500ms-1s)
2. Creating session (500ms-1s)
3. Generating questions with OpenAI (2-5s)
4. Generating audio with MurfAI (1-3s)

**Total: 5-10 seconds** - causing Twilio timeout!

## ✅ Solution: Deferred Processing (Again!)

### Before (Blocking):
```
User presses 1
    ↓
Create user (1s)
Create session (1s)
Generate question (3s)
Generate audio (2s)
    ↓
Respond to Twilio (TIMEOUT after 10s!)
```

### After (Non-blocking):
```
User presses 1
    ↓
Respond immediately (<1s): "Please hold..."
Redirect to: /start-interview
    ↓
[Background] Create user & session
    ↓
/start-interview called
Generate question (3s)
Generate audio (2s)
Ask first question
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Split Menu Handling**

**File**: `src/routes/webhooks.js`

**New Endpoints**:
- `/webhook/start-interview` - Starts mock interview
- `/webhook/start-coaching` - Starts coaching session

**Flow**:
1. `/webhook/menu` - Responds immediately with "Please hold..."
2. Redirects to `/start-interview` or `/start-coaching`
3. Those endpoints handle the heavy processing

### 2. **Fixed WAV Audio Corruption**

**File**: `src/services/murfaiService.js`

**Problem**: Was stripping WAV header, creating invalid files
**Solution**: Keep complete WAV chunks from MurfAI

```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong)
if (firstChunk && audioBytes.length > 44) {
  audioChunks.push(audioBytes.slice(44)); // ❌ Corrupted audio
}

// AFTER (Correct)
audioChunks.push(audioBytes); // ✅ Valid audio
```

### 3. **Better Audio Serving**

**File**: `src/routes/audio.js`

- Added file size validation
- Added empty file check
- Added Content-Length header
- Better error logging

git commit -m "Fix menu timeout and WAV audio corruption"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Startup:
```
✅ ✓ Generated 5/5
✅ Common messages pre-generated successfully
✅ Server running on port 3000
```

### When User Calls:
```
✅ POST /webhook/voice (500ms)
   → "Welcome to AI Interview Coaching..."
   → "Press 1 for mock interview..."

✅ POST /webhook/menu (500ms)
   → "Great! Please hold..."
   → Redirect to /start-interview

✅ POST /webhook/start-interview (5-8s)
   → Generate question
   → Generate audio
   → "Here's your first question..."
```

### Response Times:
| Endpoint | Time | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| `/webhook/voice` | <2s | ✅ Fast |
| `/webhook/menu` | <1s | ✅ Fast |
| `/start-interview` | 5-8s | ✅ Acceptable |
| Audio serving | <200ms | ✅ Fast |
